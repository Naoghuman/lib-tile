 * <p />
 * The {@link javafx.scene.image.Image}s from the specifically {@link com.github.naoghuman.lib.tile.core.Tile}s 
 * are outsourced into the library <code>Lib-Tile-TransparentTextures-Images</code> with the attention to 
 * reduce the size from this library and to allowed the customized loading from <code>Tiles</code>
